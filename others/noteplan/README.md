### m1well theme
If you use Noteplan 3, you can use my own created theme by copying it to the Noteplan theme folder.  
The app uses Cloudkit and doesn't support symlinks, that why you have to copy the theme after a change.  
Currently this is following command:  
`cp ${M1WELL_TOOLSUITE_HOME}/env-setup/others/noteplan/m1well-theme.json ${USER_HOME}/Library/Containers/co.noteplan.NotePlan3/Data/Library/Application Support/co.noteplan.NotePlan3/Themes`
